			<h1>Services</h1>
			<p>
			Whether your project involves Audio Services for
			film, video games, TV, radio or any other form of
			media, look no further for great audio. I will
			provide a finished audio product ready for
			integration. Deliverables can be audio files in any
			format, DAW session (Pro Tools, logic, DP) or
			middleware project files (Fmod and Wwise).
			</p>

			<h2>Sound Design</h2>
			<p>
			Custom effects edited and spotted to the precise
			location for maximum impact. Extensive effect
			libraries augmented by foley and morphing provide
			the foundation for adding excitement, emotion, and
			depth.
			</p>

			<h2>Music Composition</h2>
			<p>
			Original music and ambience that is fresh and
			engaging. Along with effects, an effective musical
			score will help tell your story and get your point
			across.
			</p>

			<h2>Voice Over / ADR</h2>
			<p>
			Dialogue tracking, editing and replacement.  Superb
			microphones and gear make it easy to achieve a
			clean synchronized dialogue track.<br />
			</p>

			<h2>Audio Sweetening</h2>
			<p>
			Whether it is salvaging poor audio or just putting
			on the finishing touches, I can get your audio
			sounding great, fast. The right tools and expertise
			will optimize your project&rsquo;s audio quality
			and give it that professional sheen everyone
			expects.
      </p>

      <h1>Pricing</h1>
      <p>
			Rates vary between $30-$40/hr depending upon
			project size and scope. Drop me a line with some
			details about the needs of your project and I will
			email a quote.
			</p>

			<h2>Request a quote</h2>
			<p>
			If you would like to get a quote on your project,
			send an email with as many details as possible
			about the type of work you are looking for. The
			scope, timeline, delivery format and stylistic
			notes would be most helpful.  I will probably have
			a few more questions, but we can at least begin to
			determine exactly what you need and the most
			effective delivery vehicle.
			</p>
      <p>
			Once I begin to understand the project vision, I
			will create some samples for you to review before
			the work begins.
